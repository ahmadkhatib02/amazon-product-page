        <b> The cats of America are under siege!</b>
        <p>
            Long gone are the good old days when a cat’s
            biggest worries were mean dogs or a bath. Modern cats must confront satanists, 
            online predators, the possibility of needing to survive in a 
            post-apocalyptic wasteland, and countless other threats to
            their nine lives.

            For over four decades, the American Association of Patriots 
            have stood at the vanguard of our country's defense by helping 
            to prepare our nation's cat owners for the difficult 
            conversations they dread having with their pets.

            Written in a simple Q&A format, How to Talk to Your Cat About 
            Gun Safety answers crucial questions such as, “What is the right
            age to talk to my cat about the proper use of firearms?” and 
            “What are the benefits of my cat living a lifestyle of 
            abstinence?” and especially “Why does my cat need to use the 
            internet? Can’t he just play with yarn like cats used to do?”
